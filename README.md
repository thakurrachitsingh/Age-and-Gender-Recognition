<h2>Objective :</h2>
<p>To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) through webcam.</p>

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p>The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100). </p>

<h2>Additional Python Libraries Required :</h2>
<ul>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  
       pip install opencv-python
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>argparse</li>
  
       pip install argparse
</ul>

 <p>For face detection, we have a .pb file- this is a protobuf file (protocol buffer); it holds the graph definition and the trained weights of the model. We can use this to run the trained model. And while a .pb file holds the protobuf in binary format, one with the .pbtxt extension holds it in text format. These are TensorFlow files. For age and gender, the .prototxt files describe the network configuration and the .caffemodel file defines the internal states of the parameters of the layers.</p>
